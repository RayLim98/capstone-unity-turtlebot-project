Title: Studying the Effects of background motion on SSVEP BCI in a live environment 

    Rather than traditional "dark" plain background, the scenario contains a live view of remote environment. 

    SSVEP flickers are overlapped on this live background. 

    Control study: compare standard SSVEP performance Vs Live-SSVEP performance 

    Offline analysis: No explicit BCI control, (EEG recording, sample analysis) 

    Online System: Live camera + Control movement using SSVEP(left, right, forward) 

    Estimate the correlation between background noise with performance.
